Labas sana tayo mamaya to take a picture of us for our 1st monthsarry, nothing naisip ko lang how cute is it if we had a picture of us every month and formed it a heart HAHAHA. But it's okay madami pa namang araw HAHAHAHA and be safety when you go head later and be home safely I'm here just waiting 😊. And imissyou 🫰🏻

And okay sorry if it is too late I'll send the link of the video I made from April, then open it when you're home na ha. I'll send here for a while lang.


And for too much questions and for bothering you earlier, I'm really sorry that I just want us to sleep without misunderstanding or miscommunication i really wanted to know if what I did specifically last night bigla kang nawala sa mood. And yeah I really sorry for bothering you too much kanina, and maybe you're tired lang for the whole day. Be safe later po and have a nice day ahead.

Thank you so much for having you, for being there by my side throughout everything and how I used to treat you sometimes hihi. And I hope you know how much I value and appreciate you because you're the only one and the best person I have. Thank you for always saving me and for giving me some motivation to not give up. And thank you for always understanding my moods in the past few weeks for being rude, irritable and everything HAHAHAHA. Thank you for being my takbuhan when never I feel stress and sad, you don't hesitate to go with me even there is something important matters you to do but you still go with me to take a breath for a while. Always remember that I will choose you always even the days we didn't understand each other even the days we fight and hating each other. But you know that I will always run by your side always. Thank you loving me so much and for understanding my overthinking mood sometimes. Pagod na akue mag english mami so ayun sana hindi kapa mapagod na intindihin ang overthinking moods ko kahit na nakakapagod na din ako sometimes and sana kapag dumating yung point na napagod kana saakin mo parin hanapin yung pahinga nayun. From the top and bottom of my heart thank you so muchhy for the love and care you gave and for letting me experience all the first time in my life if you know how much happy I am to be with you and also to go with you outside seeing you is better enough to wipe all the stress and tiredness I feel. Mahal na mahal kita palagi lagi even hindi ko na express sa daily convo natin pero mahal kita ng sobra i wish na sana ikaw na yung makasama ko sa lahat and sana kasama parin kita when the time and universe allow me to be on the top sana kasama kita from zero days to wala ng aalalahanin na hindi na mangangambang na zero. Always remember din na andito lang ako palagi para sayo to support you in everything you do and to boost you up for your growth, I know you're not the type of person who yaps in everything but I also love if you would share something if there's heavy inside you and I will do everything the best so I could wipe that. Iloveyou so much my bebii, my love and my pretty wifey. Ingatan mo rin yung sarili mo and more gala to have pa and more months to be with you until we came to anniversary. Even I'm not the best wife you have, but I will do everything I can to be the one you wanted to. Iloveyou so much ipag luluto pa kita ng madami daming pagkain at mag sa sabay pa tayong kumain at saka mag tatabi pa tayong matulog,imissyou na rin sana mag sama na tayo. Iloveyou happy Monthsary mahal ko 💋imissyou.

Akala ko nga di kana babalik nung nakaraan muntik ko ng tanggapin na baka lumayo ka dahil sa napalayo rin kita,and there's so many trials in life that made us weak for how many days but what ever it's takes you know na I will always choose you with the whole heart and love I have for you. Although our relationship is not perfect everyday, and me to my self I now sometimes I'm not good enough and not the best person you have, but I will do all my best to prove myself and my love na hindi ka sa sayangin. A day without conversation with you is so damn hard (maga cry nalang siya ng slight) I know na there's is a time na mahirap rin akong intindihin and I'm sorry for that if sometimes ambilis kong mawala sa mood, then puro ako overthink at akue pa yung lumalaban talaga eh HAHAHAHA. So sana tatagan pa natin kasi tayo lang rin yung nakakaalam kung paano natin kinakaya yung lahat, kasi tayo lang rin yung nakakaintindi sa paraan na kung paano natin mahalin yung isa't isa kahit na hindi perpekto, pero totoo. And palagi mong tandaan na andito lang ako sa tabi mo palagi hindi ako aalis, palagi kong pipiliin na intindihin ka at yung mga trials na pinag daanan natin and I will love you in your darkest and be with you in your lowest and stay with your hardest and celebrate our happiest. In short tanggap kita sa lahat and I will always got your back lovee, even in the days we hate each other. Sana mag stay yung kindness natin sa isa't isa if there's a time na nararamdaman nating magulo na sobra at kung di na makita yung saya. And ayunn sana palagi kang okay have a good health and goodluck sa mga gawain mo goodluck sa mga dreams mo sana matupad mo yun isa isa sasamahan kita in everything as long as I'm here you will always have someone who is always proud of you no matter what achievements you have I will always be proud and happy to support you with everything that makes you learn and grow. When you feel unloved always remember na I'm always here for you and you'll never be unloved by me.
